A#sync Chat Application with Django
Welcome to the Async Chat Application built with Django! This project explores the implementation of asynchronous features in Django to create a real-time chat experience. In this README, we'll walk through the process and architecture of this application.

Overview
This chat application leverages Django's asynchronous capabilities to handle multiple simultaneous connections efficiently. By using Django Channels, we enable real-time communication between clients and the server, ensuring instant messaging without the need for constant page refreshes.

Features
Real-time messaging: Experience instant messaging without delays.
User authentication: Secure user authentication system.
Room creation and management: Users can create and join chat rooms.
WebSocket communication: Efficient communication between server and clients using WebSockets.
Asynchronous views: Utilize Django's async views for handling multiple requests concurrently.
How It Works
The chat application follows a client-server architecture where Django serves as the backend server handling user requests and WebSocket connections. Here's how the process looks like:

User Authentication: Users register or log in to access the chat application.
Creating or Joining Rooms: Once authenticated, users can create new chat rooms or join existing ones.
Real-time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly within the chat rooms.
Asynchronous Handling: Django Channels asynchronously manages WebSocket connections, ensuring efficient communication.
Database Interaction: Messages and room data are stored and retrieved from the database as needed.
Setup
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run migrations to set up the database: python manage.py migrate.
Start the Django development server: python manage.py runserver.
That's it! You should now be able to access the chat application locally.
